## Shading Calculation 

This script was taken and has been slightly modified from https://github.com/FlyingPotato437/srikanth_coral_shading_script/tree/main.

It takes a directory containing `.ply` files as input, and outputs a `.csv` file containing shading metrics for each `.ply` file.

### Installation 

`pip install -r requirments.txt`

### Usage 

`python calculate_shading.py --input_plot /path/to/ply/file`
